Given an array arr, rotate the array by one position in clock-wise direction.

Examples:

Input: arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: [5, 1, 2, 3, 4]
Explanation: If we rotate arr by one position in clockwise 5 come to the front and remaining those are shifted to the end.



class Solution {
  public:
    void rotate(vector<int> &arr ) 
    {
       int end = arr[arr.size()-1] ;
       for(int i = ((arr.size()) - 1) ; i > 0 ; i--)
       {
           arr[i] = arr[i-1] ;
       }
          arr[0] = end ;
     }
};
